# stereoAnalysis.praat
# Paul Boersma, 21 October 2025
#
# This script checks that analyses on stereo sounds make sense
# as compared to each other and as compared to analyses on mono sounds.
#
# This script uses pre-2014 syntax, because we like to measure the history of Praat
# since multi-channel sounds were introduced in 2007.
#
# We need Praat version 5 (from 2009) or up, though,
# because version 4 didn't have objectsAreIdentical() yet.
# Requiring version 5 or up also means that we can use praatVersion and object []
# and that we can be certain that stereo sounds were supported.

#
# CREATING STEREO SOUNDS
#
# Stereo sounds were supported since 2007, and the oldest version we are testing
# is 5.1.12 from 2009. Therefore, the following code works from version 5.1.12 on.
#

#
# Create a stereo sound with only the left channel filled.
#
chan1.Sound = Create Sound from formula... chan1 stereo 0.0 1.0 44100
... if row = 1 then 1/2 * sin(2*pi*377*x) + randomGauss(0,0.1) else 0.0 fi

#
# Create the mirror image of that sound.
#
chan2.Sound = Create Sound from formula... chan2 stereo 0.0 1.0 44100
... object [chan1.Sound, 3 - row, col]

#
# Create the sum sound.
#
sum.Sound = Create Sound from formula... sum stereo 0.0 1.0 44100
... object [chan1.Sound] + object [chan2.Sound]

#
# Create the difference sound.
#
difference.Sound = Create Sound from formula... difference stereo 0.0 1.0 44100
... object [chan1.Sound] - object [chan2.Sound]

#
# Create the average sound.
#
average.Sound = Create Sound from formula... average stereo 0.0 1.0 44100
... 0.5 * object [sum.Sound]

#
# PITCH ANALYSIS
#
# The pitch analysis should give the exact same result on all five sounds.
# This is because channel averaging occurs late, namely at the autocorrelation level.
#
# The following code works from Praat version 5.1.12 on.
#

select Sound chan1
chan1.Pitch = To Pitch... 0.01 75 600

# SPECTROGRAM ANALYSIS
#
# The spectrogram analysis should give the exact same result for the two channels,
# because averaging is done at the level of the power spectral density.
#
# Also, the sum and difference sounds should give the exact same results as each other,
# because averaging is done after squaring.
